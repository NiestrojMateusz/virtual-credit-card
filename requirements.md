Integration specification
The card is created by VISA SDK. It's already used somewhere else within our app. We just have to call a specific function they provide.

Copy/pasting details from their documentation:

Public interfaces
export function createVirtualCreditCard(): Promise<CreditCard>;

export type CreditCard = {
id: number;
holder: string;
expiry: Date;
cvc: number;
color?: string;
};
Usage
import { createVirtualCreditCard, CreditCard } from 'visa-client';

const card: CreditCard = await createVirtualCreditCard();
Output sample
{
"id": 1234567890111213,
"holder": "Nik Sumeiko",
"expiry": 2025-05-21T15:27:03.885Z,
"cvc": 123,
"color": "red"
}
